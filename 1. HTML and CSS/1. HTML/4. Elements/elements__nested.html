<!--
    Nested HTML Elements
    HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

    All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

    The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!--
    Example Explained
    The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

    It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

    Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:
-->

<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>


<!--
    The <body> element defines the document's body.

    It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.

    Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>:
-->

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<!--
    The <h1> element defines a heading.

    It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>:

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
-->

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<!--
    The <p> element defines a paragraph.

    It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>:
-->

<p>My first paragraph.</p>
