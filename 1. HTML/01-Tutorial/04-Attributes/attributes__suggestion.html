    We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
    The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

    The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

    However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.

    Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:
-->

<p title=About W3Schools>Content

    Single or Double Quotes?
    Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

    In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:
-->

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>Type 1</p>

<!--
    Or vice versa:
-->

<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">Type 2</p>
