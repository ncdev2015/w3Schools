<!--
    HTML is Not Case Sensitive
    HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

    The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

    At W3Schools we always use lowercase tag names.
