<!--
    HTML Documents
    
    All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
    The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
    The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!--
    The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration

    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
